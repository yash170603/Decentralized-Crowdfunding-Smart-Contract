# Decentralized-Crowdfunding-Smart-Contract
Decentralized Crowdfunding Smart Contract
This repository contains a decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract enables transparent and secure fundraising campaigns without the need for intermediaries. It leverages the power of smart contracts to automate the crowdfunding process, including contributions, voting on funding requests, and fund transfers.

Features
Contributors can send Ether (ETH) to the campaign and become part of the project.
Voting system for contributors to approve funding requests made by the project manager.
Automatic fund transfer to the designated recipient once the target amount is reached.
Refund mechanism for contributors if the target is not met within the specified deadline


Usage
Deploy the smart contract to the desired Ethereum network (local, testnet, or mainnet).
Interact with the contract by calling its functions using a tool like Remix, Truffle console, or web3.js.
